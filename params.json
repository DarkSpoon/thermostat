{"name":"Thermostat","tagline":"web and python code for Raspberry Pi powered HVAC thermostat","body":"# About\r\nThis is a project I decided to build for my new place. The thermostat is powered by a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.element14.com/community/groups/raspberry-pi) running [Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org/). Temperature sensing will be done with a [DS18B20](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-11-ds18b20-temperature-sensing/overview). A [Sainsmart 4-Channel 5V relay module](http://www.sainsmart.com/arduino-compatibles/module/relay/4-channel-5v-relay-module-for-pic-arm-avr-dsp-arduino-msp430-ttl-logic.html) will switch the actual devices on via existing wiring in the house. Some minor output will be displayed on a [HD44780](http://www.rpiblog.com/2012/11/interfacing-16x2-lcd-with-raspberry-pi.html). The main interface will be the web site hosted on the device itself. All data will be stored in a MySQL database and accessed with php. Server side python code will handle the calculations and the flipping of relays. \r\n\r\nThe code is ugly and the website isn't much to look at either right now. But that will all come with time.\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n![Home screen](http://i.imgur.com/HlH4R5z.jpg)\r\n![Scheduling](http://i.imgur.com/g5FiW1L.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
